    "# Library Management System Using Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project focuses on creating an efficient Library Management system, by using just linked lists. A library managment system is designed to easily manage storge, retrival & tracking of books in a library. it efficiently stores all the data related to availability, transaction and return status of the books.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we are trying to implement a way where we perform all the basic operations needed in a Library Management System without using traditional methods like arrays or relational databases. While arrays provide with direct indexing without the use of pointers, they have fixed size and memory, making it difficult for operations like insertion and deletion.\n",
    "By using linked lists, we enable dynamic memory management, efficient insertions and deletions.\n",
    "w\n",
    "The system allows:\n",
    "- Adding books to the library.\n",
    "- Retrieving book details.\n",
    "- Checking book availability.\n",
    "- Limiting users to borrowing a maximum of 3 books.\n",
    "- Borrowing and returning books.\n",
    "- Tracking all transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept of Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list is a dynamic data structure which has data stored in elements called **\"nodes\"**, with each node containing a **value** and a **pointer** to the next node in the sequence. This pointer is a variable referencing the memory address to the next node. Unlike an array it doesn't store data in a contiguous manner and the allocation can be random depending on the memory availability. It contains properties like:-\n",
    "- **Dynamic Memory** allocation\n",
    "- **Efficent** insertion and deletion\n",
    "- Can be stored wherever free memory is available\n",
    "\n",
    "  We are planning to use three linked lists to support the system:-\n",
    "1. **Books List**: Stores details about books, such as title, author, Book ID, and availability.\n",
    "2. **Users List**: Stores user details, including user ID, name, and borrowed books.\n",
    "3. **Transactions List**: Records book borrow and return activities for tracking purposes.\n",

    "## Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concept related to our Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall design of the project is based on OOPs principles which helps in creating a structured, scalable and reusable system.\n",
    "### Key OOPs Concepts Used:\n",
    "1. **Classes and Objects**  \n",
    "   - A **class** defines the blueprint for objects, while **objects** are instances of classes.  \n",
    "   - We create separate classes for **Node, Person, Student, Librarian, Book, HardCopy, EBook, LinkedList**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encapsulation**  \n",
    "   - Data and operations related to books, users, and transactions are grouped inside respective classes.  \n",
    "   - This ensures data integrity and prevents direct modification of attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Abstraction**  \n",
    "   - Users can interact with simple functions like *borrow_book()* and *return_book()*, without knowing internal implementations.  \n",
    "   - The complexity of linked list management is hidden.\n"

    "## CONCLUSION\n",
    "The project covers essential data structure operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal, ensuring that book records, users, and borrowing history are managed efficiently. The use of three separate linked lists (for books, users, and transactions) allows for independent yet interconnected data handling, mimicking a real-world library system.\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating different book types (HardCopy and EBook) and user types (Students and Librarians), the system shows how inheritance and data abstraction can simplify real-world situations. The transaction tracking list provides a way to monitor borrowed books and returning, ensuring accountability of the user."
