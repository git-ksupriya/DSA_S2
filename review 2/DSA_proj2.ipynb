    "# Library Management System Using Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "## PROJECT OVERVEIW :-\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project focuses on creating an efficient Library Management system, by using just linked lists. A library managment system is designed to easily manage storge, retrival & tracking of books in a library. it efficiently stores all the data related to availability, transaction and return status of the books.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we tried to implement a way where we perform all the basic operations needed in a Library Management System without using traditional methods like arrays or relational databases. Along with an interative user-engaging experience for librarian and students depending on their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system allows:\n",
    "- Adding books to the library.\n",
    "- Retrieving book details.\n",
    "- Checking book availability.\n",
    "- Limiting users to borrowing a maximum of 3 books.\n",
    "- Borrowing and returning books.\n",
    "- Tracking all transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linked list and its implementation \n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list is a dynamic data structure which has data stored in elements called **nodes**, with each node containing a **value** and a **reference** to the next node in the sequence. Here in our project we are incorporating three methods from the linked list class: insert_end, delete, display and size.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **insert_end(data)**: Inserts a node at the end of the linked list. This is useful for adding new books, users, or transaction records dynamically.\n",
    "2. **delete(title)**: Removes a node from the linked list based on the title of the book. This allows librarians to manage the book collection by removing books that are no longer available.\n",
    "3. **display()**: Traverses the linked list and prints the details of all nodes. This helps in visualizing the records stored in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are chosen because the project primarily requires adding, removing, and displaying records. Other linked list operations, such as inserting at specific positions or searching, were not necessary for our requirements.\n"

    "## CONCLUSION\n",
    "The project covers essential data structure operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal, ensuring that book records, users, and borrowing history are managed efficiently. The use of three separate linked lists (for books, users, and transactions) allows for independent yet interconnected data handling, mimicking a real-world library system.\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating different book types (HardCopy and EBook) and user types (Students and Librarians), the system shows how inheritance and data abstraction can simplify real-world situations. The transaction tracking list provides a way to monitor borrowed books and returning, ensuring accountability of the user."
